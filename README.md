1: Classical Encryption Techniques

Objective: - To understand the concept of passwords, Brute Force Techniques.
1. Develop a program to show the workings of substitution method.
2. Develop a login system, which will take two inputs username and password (4 digit
pin). As an Adversary develop a program, which will generate passwords serially, and
find the right password for the developed login system.

2: Shift Cipher Techniques

Objective: - To understand the concept of Shift Ciphers.
1. Implement a program to show the working of Caesar cipher.

The Caesar cipher is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter  in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who apparently used it to communicate with his generals.

2. Implement a program to show the working of Vigen√®re cipher.

3: DES Encryption Techniques

Objective: - To understand the concept of Block Ciphers
1. Implement the Data Encryption Standards.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4: AES Encryption Techniques

Objective: - To understand the concept of Block Ciphers
1. Implement the Advanced Encryption Standards.

5: Public key Cryptography:

Objective: - To understand the concept of secret key, cipher and plain text.
1. Design a system, which will demonstrate the working of RSA public key
cryptography.

6: Diffie Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm:

Objective: - To understand the concept of exchanging keys through Diffie Hellman.
1. Design a system, which will demonstrate the working of Diffie Hellman.

7: Hash Function

Objective: - To understand the concept of Integrity, Non-repudiation and message
digest.
1. Write a program to demonstrate the working of SHA-512.
2. Create a mail (treat it as a string) and attach the digital signature with your mail.
show that the attached digital signature can be used to:
a. Verify the author and the date and time of the signature.
b. Authenticate the contents at the time of the signature.
